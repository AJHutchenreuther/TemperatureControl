# TemperatureControl
A simple temperature controller using ON/OFF control of resistive load (incandescent bulb in insulated box). 
The controller hardware is based on Texas Instruments MSP430 Launch Pad or Arduino Uno R3. 
The target application is to implement a process for making yogurt in the home.
Control of temperature is desired to give repeatable results for all seasons.  

- Description of temperature control is in Yogurt Culture Controller.docx
- My yogurt recipe is in MyHomemadeYogurt.docx
- Program code is in TemperatureControl_MSP430_20Oct.ino

The code is identical for Arduino or MSP430.   I chose to use the MSP430 because the hardware was on hand.
Development environment for TI is Energia version 0101E0013.  Reference http://energia.nu/
